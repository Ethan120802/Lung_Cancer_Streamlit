# Lung Cancer Detection

Project based on Machine Learning

If lung cancer is found at an earlier stage, when it is small and before it has spread, it is more likely to be treated successfully.

Lung cancer screening is recommended for certain people who smoke or used to smoke, but who don't have any signs or symptoms. If a person has lung cancer but doesn't have any symptoms, this usually means there's a chance to detect the disease early.

Usually symptoms of lung cancer don't appear until the disease is already at an advanced stage. Even when lung cancer does cause symptoms, many people may mistake them for other problems, such as an infection or long-term effects from smoking. This may delay the diagnosis.

Symptoms and the results of certain tests may strongly suggest that a person has lung cancer, but the actual diagnosis is made by looking at lung cells in the lab.

The cells can be taken from lung secretions (mucus you cough up from the lungs), fluid removed from the area around the lung (thoracentesis), or from a suspicious area using a needle or surgery (biopsy). The choice of which test(s) to use depends on the situation.

## Installation

The following libraries are needed

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install mljar-mercury
pip install matplotlib
```

### Notes 
- Model needs to be trained on various algo (Logistic done)
- implement model in webapp
- hosting maybe
- CNN Angle 
- Using google ml tool
